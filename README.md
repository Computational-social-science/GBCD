# GBCD

The global competition for human capital is fuelled by intricate brain circulation dynamics, where individuals with specialized skills traverse geographic, organizational, and national boundaries to address workforce demands. However, a comprehensive framework for integrating and interpreting heterogeneous data on global brain circulation remains elusive. Here we introduce the Global Brain Circulation Dynamics (GBCD) corpus, a longitudinally integrated repository of geo-information encompassing 223 countries/regions from 2000 to 2024. Garnered from diachronic narrative texts, the GBCD corpus provides granular insights into transnational brain circulation patterns and their interconnections with sociocultural progress. Continuously updated to reflect spatiotemporal dynamics, the GBCD corpus serves as a definitive reference for real-time and ex-post analysis of global brain circulation. Our analysis reveals two pivotal findings: (i) narrative brain circulation closely mirrors physical brain mobility, and (ii) geopolitical relations and spatiotemporal dynamics exhibit distinct patterns across countries/regions. The GBCD corpus establishes a novel benchmark for examining spatiotemporal brain circulation worldwide, empowering policymakers to develop evidence-based strategies for attracting and retaining human capital in rapidly evolving global landscape.

## Corpus
The GBCD corpus is a comprehensive dataset comprising 2,904,663,710 tokens, structured into two distinct corpora: diachronic and synchronic. The corpus encompasses 1,273,626 entries related to brain circulation features, with the diachronic corpus accounting for 1,132,674 entries that span a 24-year period (2000-2024). Notably, the diachronic corpus is continuously updated in real-time, ensuring the data remains current and relevant for both real-time and ex-post analyses of brain circulation. In contrast, the synchronic corpus contains 140,952 entries, deliberately excluding timestamp features to facilitate synchronic research.

## Data record
The corpus captures key attributes relevant to brain circulation, including origin, destination, diachronic narrative text, URL, and timestamp. Notably, geographic entities are mapped to the global country or region level, facilitating the analysis of transnational brain circulation.  Each country or region is accompanied by Countrycode, ISO2, and ISO3 identifiers, enabling multidimensional organization of brain circulation data. Furthermore, we distinguish between origin and destination in geographic entities related to circulation flow, allowing for the representation of brain gain and brain drain, and providing insights into bilateral brain circulation between countries.

### Geographic entity criteria
The GBCD corpus spans 223 countries and regions worldwide, encompassing 193 UN member states, one observer state, and 29 non-sovereign island territories.Our national geographic divisions adhere to methods endorsed by the United Nations Statistics Division for international statistical data collection, ensuring consistency and compatibility with global standards.
* **Member State of the United Nations:** refers to a sovereign country that has been officially admitted to the United Nations (UN) and holds full membership status. Member States enjoy voting rights, participate in all UN activities, and are bound by the principles outlined in the UN Charter.
  - [UN Membership](https://www.un.org/zh/about-us/member-states)
* **Non-Member Observer State of the United Nations:** refers to an entity recognized by the United Nations General Assembly that has observer status, granting it certain privileges and participation rights in UN activities, but without full membership or voting rights in the General Assembly.
  - [Palestine](https://documents.un.org/doc/undoc/gen/n12/479/73/pdf/n1247973.pdf)
* **Regions without Internationally Recognized Sovereignty:** refer to territories or regions that declare themselves as independent or autonomous but lack widespread recognition as sovereign states under international law or by the global community, including the United Nations.
